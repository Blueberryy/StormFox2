## Moonparses
    Problems:  
        Russian tosaters can't handle dynamic texture changes and RT. It could have been me not checking for pixelshader support but still.
        People complain that the realistic system where wrong (Moon does curve in rotation)

    Make it pr day based and render the parses. Maybe even just pre-make them.

## Texture Swap
    Problems:
        Doesn't work atm. When calling the function it just refuses to update the map.
        Also doesn't have a way for map-creators to work with.

## Menu
    - Make the menu the same as SF1, however update the design abit
    - People got confused with the "Set Weather", instead have a list of weathers they can select and a slider for amount.

## Other
    - Mixer seems to glitch out now and then. Need to fix it somehow.
    - Sunset/rise has a wider area irl

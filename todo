## Moonparses
    Problems:  
		People complain that the realistic system where wrong (Moon does curve in rotation)
		Terrain footprints should be removed, if the next terrain doesn't have footprints.
    Make it pr day based and render the parses. Maybe even just pre-make them.

## Texture Swap
	- Doesn't have a way for map-creators to work with.

## Other
    - Sunset/rise has a wider area irl

## Rain / Particles
	- Seem to ignore glass (Remember, bullet masks ignore glass)

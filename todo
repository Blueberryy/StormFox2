## Rain framework
A) Make a particle system.
    Pro: Works for all weather types
        Allows other creators to make their own effects without adding the complex calculations.

    Con: High chance the community won't use it
        It is a semi-complex system itself

B) Make the weather-type handle it with .Think and .Render hooks.
    Pro: It is easy to copypasta for other weather types
        Adding a binding for the weather, allows for other effects / code being added.

    Con: Write everything from scratch every time.
        It requires the sub-creators to make their calculations correct, or SF gets the blame.
        There still need to be some sort of system they can use.

## Moonparses
    Problems:  
        Russian tosaters can't handle dynamic texture changes and RT. It could have been me not checking for pixelshader support but still.
        People complain that the realistic system where wrong (Moon does curve in rotation)

    Make it pr day based and render the parses. Maybe even just pre-make them.

## Texture Swap
    Problems:
        Doesn't work atm. When calling the function it just refuses to update the map.
        Also doesn't have a way for map-creators to work with.

## Menu
    - Make the menu the same as SF1, however update the design abit
    - People got confused with the "Set Weather", instead have a list of weathers they can select and a slider for amount.

## Soundsystem
    - Make a system that caches sound-locations
    - Snd objects on the side of the window / entity is required
    - Outside can be defined by surfaces on the map?
        Pro: Constant and doesn't have to re-calculated
        Con: Surfaceinfos aren't on all the map
        Idea: Make a circle system where from the avage point will be cener and range of the "outside" zone. This will increase the FPS and lower the need for traers.
    

## Other
    - Mixer seems to glitch out now and then. Need to fix it somehow.
    - Sunset/rise has a wider area irl

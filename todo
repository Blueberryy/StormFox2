## Moonparses
    Problems:  
		People complain that the realistic system where wrong (Moon does curve in rotation)
		Terrain footprints should be removed, if the next terrain doesn't have footprints.
    Make it pr day based and render the parses. Maybe even just pre-make them.

## Texture Swap
    Problems:
        Doesn't work atm. When calling the function it just refuses to update the map.
        Also doesn't have a way for map-creators to work with.

## Menu
    - People got confused with the "Set Weather", instead have a list of weathers they can select and a slider for amount.
	- Finish the menu design.

## Other
    - Mixer seems to glitch out now and then. Need to fix it somehow. (Noted it happening on time_speed 0)
    - Sunset/rise has a wider area irl
	- Maplight should be updated at all times for extra_darkness to work. Only force the "env_l" functions to call now and then

## Terrian
